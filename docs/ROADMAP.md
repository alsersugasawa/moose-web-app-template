# Web Platform Template — Feature Roadmap

Features are organized into phases by theme. Items within each phase are roughly prioritized top-to-bottom. Contributions are welcome.

---

## Phase 1 — Authentication & Identity

Strengthen the existing auth system with standard account-security features.

- [ ] **HTTPS support & certificate management** — TLS termination with automatic certificate provisioning (Let's Encrypt / ACME), renewal, and a UI in the admin portal to view certificate status, expiry, trigger manual renewal, and upload or replace custom certificates (PEM/PFX) directly from the UI
- [ ] **Email verification** — Require users to confirm their email address on registration before accessing the app
- [ ] **Password reset via email** — "Forgot password" flow with time-limited, single-use reset tokens
- [ ] **OAuth 2.0 / social login** — Sign in with Google, GitHub, etc. via the `authlib` library
- [ ] **Two-factor authentication (TOTP)** — Time-based one-time passwords (e.g. Google Authenticator, Authy)
- [ ] **Active session management** — Let users view and revoke their active JWT sessions from their profile page

---

## Phase 2 — User Management & Access Control

Move beyond the binary `is_admin` flag to a proper permission model.

- [ ] **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** — Define named roles (e.g. `viewer`, `editor`, `manager`) and assign them to users
- [ ] **Permission scopes** — Attach fine-grained action permissions to each role, enforced at the router level
- [ ] **User profile pages** — Avatar upload, display name, bio, and per-user preferences (theme, timezone, language)
- [ ] **API key management** — Allow users to generate long-lived API keys for programmatic/service access
- [ ] **Invite-only registration** — Admin-issued invitation tokens that gate new user sign-ups

---

## Phase 3 — Developer Experience

Make the template easier to extend and customize.

- [ ] **Scaffold CLI** — `python -m scaffold router <name>` to generate a boilerplate router + schema + migration
- [ ] **Auto-generated TypeScript client** — Export an OpenAPI-derived TypeScript SDK for frontend consumption
- [ ] **Plugin architecture** — A conventions-based `plugins/` directory that auto-registers routers and models on startup
- [ ] **Feature flags** — Database-backed on/off switches per feature, configurable from the admin portal
- [ ] **Environment config profiles** — First-class `development`, `staging`, and `production` config sets via `.env.<env>` files

---

## Phase 4 — Infrastructure & Scalability

Prepare the platform for production load.

- [ ] **Redis caching layer** — Cache frequently-read query results and rate-limit counters in Redis
- [ ] **Background task queue** — Async job processing (using ARQ or Celery) for emails, exports, and long-running work
- [ ] **WebSocket support** — Real-time push notifications and live data updates via WebSocket connections
- [ ] **Database read replica routing** — Route read queries to a replica for horizontal read scaling
- [ ] **Connection pool tuning guide** — Document and expose `asyncpg` pool settings via environment variables

---

## Phase 5 — Observability & Operations

Instrument the application for production visibility.

- [ ] **Structured JSON logging** — Replace print-based logging with structured JSON output compatible with log aggregators (Loki, Datadog, CloudWatch)
- [ ] **Prometheus metrics endpoint** — `/metrics` endpoint exposing request counts, latency histograms, and DB pool stats
- [ ] **OpenTelemetry tracing** — Distributed trace context propagation across services via OTLP export
- [ ] **Sentry integration** — Automatic error capture and performance tracing with a configurable DSN
- [ ] **Enhanced health check** — `/health/detailed` endpoint that reports the status of all dependencies (DB, cache, queue)
- [ ] **Automated migration runner** — Run pending SQL migrations on container startup before the app starts accepting traffic

---

## Phase 6 — Communication & Events

Build out messaging and integration capabilities.

- [ ] **Transactional email** — SMTP / SendGrid / Mailgun integration for verification, password reset, and notification emails
- [ ] **In-app notification system** — Per-user notification inbox with read/unread state, stored in the database
- [ ] **Webhook delivery** — Allow users to register URLs that receive signed POST payloads on defined events
- [ ] **Internal event bus** — Decouple components with a lightweight publish/subscribe system for domain events

---

## Phase 7 — File Storage

Add managed file and asset handling.

- [ ] **S3-compatible storage** — Store user-uploaded files in S3 / MinIO / Cloudflare R2 with presigned URL generation
- [ ] **Image processing** — Automatic resize and thumbnail generation on upload via `Pillow`
- [ ] **File management UI** — Admin portal view for browsing, downloading, and deleting stored files

---

## Phase 8 — Frontend & UX

Modernize and expand the frontend options.

- [ ] **SPA starter option** — Provide an opt-in React (Vite) or SvelteKit frontend that consumes the existing REST API
- [ ] **Internationalization (i18n)** — String extraction, locale detection, and language-switching UI
- [ ] **Accessibility audit** — Bring all pages to WCAG 2.1 AA compliance; add keyboard navigation and screen-reader support
- [ ] **Progressive Web App (PWA)** — Add a service worker and web manifest so the app can be installed and used offline
